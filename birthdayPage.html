        <p id="bottomPadding" class="block"> On my tenth birthday, I received a total of $200 from my friends. My neighbor had those electric pocket rockets that I always wanted for myself. So me and my mom went to the store and finally bought it. But when my dad saw it later that day, he said "What the fuck is this shit?" "Return it NOW!" Eventually he returned it and kept the money for himself.</p>

Every year. For decades.</p>

        <p id="specialP">A girl's sweet 16 party is very important. As a parent, you hope your girl is happy on her very special day. However, there are some things you just have no control over.<br><br>In May 2015, Jacinda Cambray was celebrating her 16th birthday with about 40 family members and friends in the backyard of her home in Levittown, Pennsylvania when a bizarre, brown rain started to fall. As Jacinda's stepfather, Joe, explained to the local news, “Out of nowhere, from the sky, comes a bunch of feces. It looked like, if a hundred birds flew over and went to the bathroom simultaneously, that's what it would look like.”<br><br>While it's still unclear as to where the droppings originated, the family surmised the falling feces may be from one of five airplanes flying overhead at the time.<br><br>At least they ate the cake before the deluge of dung started..</p>
