        <h2>First Shit Show</h2>
        <img class="floatLeft" height="220px" width="160px" src="goofy.jpg">
        <p id="bottomPadding">On my tenth birthday, I received a total of $200 from my friends. My neighbor had those electric pocket rockets that I always wanted for myself. So me and my mom went to the store and finally bought it. But when my dad saw it later that day, he said "What the fuck is this shit?" "Return it NOW!" Eventually he returned it and kept the money for himself.</p>

        <h2>When Were You Born AGAIN????</h2>
        <img class="floatLeft" width="300px" height="300px"src="cakeInTheFace.jpg">
        <p>From my earliest memories, my mother never remembered my birthday. At the beginning of my birthday month, every single year for decades, she would would say, "When were you born again? I can never remember because I was in labor with you for five days of pure hell!" Every year. For decades.</p>
